# Bunny C2

Bunny C2 is a personal learning project where I am experimenting with **Rust** (for the backend) and **React** (for the frontend).  
The purpose of this project is to explore systems programming with Rust and modern frontend development with React by building a small **Command and Control (C2)** framework.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is created **strictly for educational purposes**.  
I am using it as a way to:

- Learn **Rust** by implementing backend logic, APIs, and concurrency patterns.
- Learn **React** by building an interactive and modern user interface.
- Understand how client-server communication works in distributed systems.

This project is **not intended for malicious use**.  
Please use responsibly and only in controlled, ethical environments.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Practice **Rust backend development** (API, file handling, networking, async).
- Practice **React frontend development** (hooks, components, state management).
- Gain an understanding of how C2-like systems communicate between clients and servers.
- Document and share progress for others learning Rust and React.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Rust** → System 
- **React** → Frontend dashboard
- - **Python** → Backend Server
- **API Communication** → JSON over HTTP/WebSocket
- **Database (optional)** → To be added later for persistence

## 📌 Current Status
This project is a **work in progress**.  
I will continue to update as I learn more and add features.

## 📚 Learning Resources
Some resources I am using:
- [The Rust Programming Language (The Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust Async Programming](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)
- [React Official Documentation](https://react.dev/)

## ✅ Usage
Since this is just for learning:
- Do **not** use it on unauthorized systems or networks.
- Feel free to fork or reuse the code for your own **educational purposes**.
